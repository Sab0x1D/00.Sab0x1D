## Whoami

I'm a cyber threat analyst by day, malware researcher by design.  
I track actors, tear down infrastructure, and quietly profile the tools they leave behind.  
Operating under `Sab0x1D`, I focus on:

- **Silent ops** – staying signal-focused and footprint-free  
- **Malware trace** – reverse engineering and behavioral deconstruction  
- **Infra teardown** – mapping and burning malicious infrastructure  

Certified Malware Researcher, building out tools to support open CTI efforts.

- 🕵️ Threat actor TTP mapping (MITRE ATT&CK driven)  
- 🧬 YARA rule development  
- 📡 IOC curation and automation
