## Whoami

I'm a cyber threat analyst by day, malware researcher by design.  
I track actors, tear down infrastructure, and quietly profile the tools they leave behind.  
Operating under `Sab0x1D`, I focus on:

- **Silent ops** ‚Äì staying signal-focused and footprint-free  
- **Malware trace** ‚Äì reverse engineering and behavioral deconstruction  
- **Infra teardown** ‚Äì mapping and burning malicious infrastructure  

Certified Malware Researcher, building out tools to support open CTI efforts.

## Current Focus

- Payload analysis & memory inspection  
- Threat actor TTP mapping (MITRE ATT&CK driven)  
- YARA rule development  
- IOC curation and automation  
- OPSEC-conscious tooling for CTI analysts
